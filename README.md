# 42-push_swap
Optimized-sorting problem using a pair of a special stack.


#### Three elements cases
How many ways can we order 3 different elements? `3! = 6`.

(You have 3 options for first position, once it is fixed you have 2 options for second position, and the third is determined by the two first decisions, so `3*2*1 = 3! = 6`)
``` python
# For stack_A
[1,2,3] -> ok
[2,3,1] -> rra -> [1,2,3] -> ok
[3,1,2] -> ra  -> [1,2,3] -> ok

[1,3,2] -> rra -> [2,1,3] -> sa  -> [1,2,3] -> ok
[3,2,1] -> sa  -> [2,3,1] -> rra -> [1,2,3] -> ok
[2,1,3] -> sa  -> [1,2,3] -> ok
```

In total we have 6 cases: 
- one already sorted
- two with a solution of 3 steps
- three with a solution of 2 steps

#### Minimize the number of operations

Leverage same-time operations: `ss`, `rr`, `rrr`.

Instead of doing 2 `ra` ops and 3 `rb` ops (5 ops), do 2 `rr` ops and 1 `rb` (3 ops).
This way we reduce the number of operations from `N + M` to `max(N, M)`.

#### Algo basics
- Starting point: all elements in stack_A.
- Target: all elements in stack_A in ascending order.
- If we have all elements in stack_B in descending order, it's direct to have stack_A in ascending order.
	- `A: /\ <-- B: \/`
- The algorithm considers the stacks are circular. So the stacks `3,2,1`, `1,3,2` and `2,1,3` are all in descending order (The final result does not do this consideration).
- The algorithm will push everything from stack_A to stack_B in descending order, slowly.
	- Is the head of stack_A a new MIN or MAX in stack_B? move it to the head of stack_B
		- If it is the MIN, we consider that it's correctly in desc order (consider the stacks are circular)
	- Otherwise, we will find its position withing stack_B manually.

#### Algo
ðŸ”¸ check if stack is already in asc-order.
- set ini and end of the longest subarray already sorted.
- if end-ini+1 == number of elemts 
	- -> already sorted!
	- else, continue
		```
		OR if end-ini+1 > 3: //jugaremos con este num: > 3? > % del total?
		- -> fix [ini, end] -> set game.a_ini, game.a_end, game.a_sorted=T
		- else, set game.a_ini=n-4, game.a_end=n-1, game.a_sorted=F```

ðŸ”¸ Start moving two elements to stack_B: `pb`, `pb`.

ðŸ”¸ Move the cheapest element from stack_A to stack_B.

Move one by one while the number os elements is stack_A > 3

âœ¨OR: averiguar el cacho mas grande ordenado y dejarlo en A. mover lo demas a B ordenadamente.

- For all elements still in stack_A, find the element with minimum cost to move to stack_B and make stack_B descending ordered. We have 2 elements in stack_B.
	- Consider how many ops we need to get each element to the head (`ra` ops for the upper half, `rra` ops for the other half) and then push it to stack_B (`pb`). Also don't forget that if stack_B is not in desc order, you need a `rb`/`rrb` (or you can use `rr` or `rrr` instead of the first `ra`/`rra`).
	- The candidates are... the head:
		- head (pos=0) needs pb or rb,pb (1 or 2)
		- pos=1 needs ra(+rb),  pb (min 2)
		- pos=3 needs ra, ra(+rb), pb (min 3)
		- ..
		- pos=n-2 needs rra, rra(+rrb), pb (min 3)
		- tail (pos=n-1) need rra(+rrb), pb (min 2)
- Continue finding the min cost element to move while maintaining stack B descendingly ordered. Now we have 3 elements in stack_B.
	- to find its position in stack_B, we need 0 or 1 (`rb`/`rrb`) ops.
	- 1 op to push it `pb`
	- to get it out of stack_A, the number of ops needed are its position for the first half (`ra`) and len-position for the other half (`rra`).
	- So, 1 + position + rb/rrb ops -> 1+pos or 1+pos+1 ops
- Continue finding the min cost element to move while maintaining stack B descendingly ordered. Now we have B elements in stack_B and A in stack_A.
	- there are B number of possible new positions, 0-B/2 ops. or >B/2 ops
	- 1 op to push it `pb`
	- to get it out of stack_A, 0-A/2 ops or >A/2 ops.
	- So, we choose the minimum between 
		- if 0-B/2 and 0-A/2 are the same op: max(0-B/2, 0-A/2) + 1
		- if 0-B/2 and 0-A/2 are not the same op: min (max(0-B/2, >A/2), max(>B/2, 0-A/2)) + 1

ðŸ”¸ Move back all elements from stack_B to stack_A


ðŸ”¸ Check that the minimum element of stack_A is at the top.
